# 8.Merging Sorted Lists
You are given an array a[] of numbers, where a[i] is the size of the i-th list to merge.  You have to produce the sequence in which to merge the lists, and the total cost of merging all the lists.  Implementation Notes: Use a heap data structure.  (You donâ€™t have to implement your own heal structure, you can simply use the inbuilt one in Java/C#.)
